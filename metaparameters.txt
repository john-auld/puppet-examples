Puppet uses four metaparameters to establish relationships, 
   and you can set each of them as an attribute in any resource.
   The value of any relationship metaparameter should be a resource reference 
   (or array of references) pointing to one or more target resources.

before — Applies a resource before the target resource.
require — Applies a resource after the target resource.
notify — Applies a resource before the target resource. The target resource refreshes if the notifying resource changes.
subscribe — Applies a resource after the target resource. The subscribing resource refreshes if the target resource changes.

Chaining Arrows
  
  -> (ordering arrow; a hyphen and a greater-than sign) — Applies the resource on the left before the resource on the right.
  
  ~> (notifying arrow; a tilde and a greater-than sign) — Applies the resource on the left first.
     If the left-hand resource changes, the right-hand resource will refresh.
