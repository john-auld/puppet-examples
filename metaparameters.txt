Puppet uses four metaparameters to establish relationships, 
   and you can set each of them as an attribute in any resource.
   The value of any relationship metaparameter should be a resource reference 
   (or array of references) pointing to one or more target resources.

before — Applies a resource before the target resource.
require — Applies a resource after the target resource.
notify — Applies a resource before the target resource. The target resource refreshes if the notifying resource changes.
subscribe — Applies a resource after the target resource. The subscribing resource refreshes if the target resource changes.
